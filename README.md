# C750-Udacity-Project

Recommend opening the Jupyter notebook file for ease of use and readability.

The region I chose was West Linn, Oregon, my hometown. The original file was nearly 400 MB and the .ipynb file was written to reflect that.
Submission
Ready to submit your project? Collect the following files:

You may also include the original Case Study scripts, but make sure it is clear which code was used for the project, and which applies to the lesson quizzes. We recommend including a Readme file to describe the contents of each file you include in your submission.
A text file containing a link to the map position you wrangled in your project, a short description of the area and a reason for your choice.
