# A case study of data wrangling using the City of West Linn, Oregon with Open Street Map data


Recommend opening the Jupyter notebook file for ease of use and readability. The region I chose was West Linn, Oregon, my hometown. The original file was nearly 400 MB and the .ipynb file was written to reflect that. The project explores the City of West Linn, Oregon using the information available in the Open Street Map. The purpose of the project is to use Data Wrangling techniques in Python to load, audit, clean and export an Open Street Map file, for further analysis using SQLite and Python data analysis libraries. 

## The repository contains the following files:


final report.pdf: Final report containing the results of the case study.

C750.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the results and the code used to audit, clean, and process the Open Street Map file.

link_file.txt: a file containing a link to the target map area

sample_city_west linn: A 10 MB example file of the original ~400 MB file

schema.py: Schema used to validate the database before writing it in a CSV file.

report.pdf: PDF document containing answers to rubric questions.
